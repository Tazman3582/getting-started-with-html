<h2>
What is the web, and what makes up the web?
</h2>

<!-- <b> and </b> are your bold tags,they make any text within them bold -->
<!-- The <p> and </p> tags break up text into paragraphs and makes thing looks more organized. this tag is also known as a block element, a subject which I will go into detail about later. -->
<!-- The <em> and </em> tags make any text within the tags italicized. --> 
<!-- the <br> tag is the line break that makes your text that follows it start on the next line. The <br> tag is an example of a void tag, which I will further delve into later. --> 
<!-- The <a href> is an anchor tag that makes links to other pages within your web page or to another page on the Internet. -->

<p>
The web is a huge network of computers, that all share information with each other. Anything can exist on the web, including
<em> videos, images, HTML, and Hyper-links</em>.
<b>Hyper-Links</b> are links between web pages, such as 
<a href="https://www.google.com"> this one</a> that links to Google.com<br>
There are four major parts of the web, which are computers, the Internet, servers, and the Internet browser. 
<b>Computers</b> are machines which run your 
<b>web browser</b>, that connects to and displays files from the 
<b>Internet</b>. Which is a huge network of 
<b>servers</b> also known as huge computers that hold gigabytes of data,and is always on and running.<br>
<em>HTTP</em> is the protocol that is used to link and communicate with servers.
</p>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>
<b>HTML</b> stands for 
<em>Hypertext Mark-up Language </em>. 
HTML is the code that most if not every page on the Internet is written in. 
HTML is made up of text content, which is what you see on a web page, mark up, which is what defines how your content is laid out, and references or links to other documents.<br> 
<em>HTML Mark up</em>, is made up of <b>elements</b>, and
<b>tags</b>   
</p>

<h2>What are Elements and Tags </h2>
<p>
<b>Elements</b> are the format in which HTML code is written. An element contains the following an opening tag, the contents of the tag, and the closing tag. Here is an example of how a element is laid out
<br>
<opening tag>content<closing tag> <!--will need to figure out how to get this to display correctly in the future. -->
<br>
Elements also come in two different forms
<em>In-line elements, and Block elements.</em>
The difference between the two, is that block elements put a invisible box around the text, whereas in-line elements do not do this.<br> 
<b>Tags</b> are the commands used to format a page, they are usually contained within angled brackets. There are 2 types of tags the first type is a tag that has an opening and closing tag like the one showed above, and there is another type of tag called a <em>void tag</em>.
They are tags that only have an opening tag such as the break tag. whereas the paragraph tag would be a normal tag. 
</p>

<h2>Computers are stupid? </h2>
<p>
I personally do not think computers in general are stupid, but they are in one way. <b>Computers take EVERYTHING literally!!!</b> As a result when a programmer writes code they have to be careful, because the computer will interpret everything even mistakes as if it is a command.So be careful when programming and always double check your work.
</p>

<h2>Remember that you can't remember everything.</h2>
<p>
The one thing you should remember as a programmer is that you cant remember every command for every language you encounter. 
<b>But</b> that is why there is this wonderful source called <a href="https://www.google.com">Google.com</a>, that is there to help you if you ever can't remember that certain command that you need.
